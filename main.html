    <div class="article">
        <p>In an imaginary future, Calgary (Alberta, Canada) experiences fast population and economic growth and transforms into a “global city”. Following a sharp increase of demand for public transportation and in a context of mass transit revolution in North America, the light rail system of the city is upgraded with new extensions and lines. With a great dose of optimism, I envision how this light rail network could look like in 2040.</p></div>

    <br>
 <p> In a fictional world, Calgary eventually fullfils its potential. The city achieves its economic diversification and becomes a new green energy hub. Canada’s population explodes and many of the new immigrant streams direct to Calgary. Considering the population of the municipality increased by almost 300K inhabitants between 2011 and 2021, I estimate in a best-case scenario that the population will hit 2.5M people by 2040. The metropolitan area would reach 3M people.
</p>
<br>
<figure><img src="calgary.jpeg" class="articleimage"></img></figure>
<br>
<p>  Such population changes must be accommodated with a transformation of the public transit system. In Calgary, public transit comprises of a network of buses and a light-rail system called the C-Train, which will be the object of our focus. The C-Train is a light rail rapid transit system functioning much like a light metro system, at the exception of the downtown core where it operates similarly to an urban tramway given the density of stations in the free-fare zone. It began operation on May 25, 1981 and has continuously expanded as the city gained inhabitants. As of 2017, it is one of the busiest light rail transit systems in North America, with 306,900 weekday riders (Wikipedia.com). Two lines are currently in operation (Red Line and Blue Line) with one additional line (Green Line) planning to be built in the years coming.
</p> <br>
<figure><img src="ctrainmap.jpeg" class="articleimage"></img></figure>
<br>
<p> In our fiction, progressive policies at the city hall gives a strong support for for new light rail lines in response to the population growth and a boom of demand for public transportation across North America. The C-Train system gets revamped with extensions on the Blue and the Red Lines to serve the furthest communities. The construction of the Green Line becomes a real growth accelerator as the economic benefits legitimate the need for further light rail lines. The city enters a period of public transit boom after 2030 and converts some of the busiest exiting bus lines into light rail with the construction of the Purple, Pink and Cyan lines. To To smoothen the connection to YYC International Airport, the city also initiates the development of the Grey Line, linking the two airports terminals to the Blue and the Green Line and hence the downtown core.
</p>
<p>  The Calgary-Edmonton corridor being one of the fastest developing region of Canada, a high speed link named “Alberta Express” is built between the two cities, with funding exceptionally coming from all levels of governance. The link could take the form of an Express Train or Hyperloop. The location of the terminal station in Calgary sits next to the airport, as it was recommended to the Standing Policy Committee on Transportation and Transit in 2020.
</p>
</p> All these changes would lead the Calgary C-Train network to look like in the map at the top of this section.
</p>
<div id="othdiv2"></div>
<div id="othdiv3"></div>

<p>  Comtemplating the pace of the development of the Green Line (it has been proposed nearly a decade ago), it is highly unlikely that the C-train map will even come close to the one I conceived. That being said, I am a firm believer in the potential of Calgary and the ability of its people to realize it, in conjugation wih favorable external factors.

    <div class="fullarticle"> <h3>Building a (missing) database</h3>
      <p>Agar.io is a free-to-play multiplayer online game, in which players control a cell (or groups of players, also called “clans”) and play against each other:</p>
      <p>"Players control one or more circular cells in a map representing a Petri dish. The goal is to gain as much mass as possible by eating agar and cells smaller than the player’s cell while avoiding larger ones which can eat the player’s cells. Each player starts with one cell, but players can split a cell into two once it reaches a sufficient mass, allowing them to control multiple cells."" (Wikipedia.com)
        <figure>      <img src="agario.jpeg" class="articleimage"><figcaption>An Agar.io gameplay. </figcaption></figure>
          <br><p>Following its release, the game quickly became a global sensation. Popular streamers and youtubers around the world started playing the game, boosting the numbers of new players. The simplicity and the strategic dimension of agar.io appealed universally and the browser version was ranked by Alexa as one of the 1,000 most visited websites in August 2015. The mobile version was equally successful as the application was downloaded 113 million times as of December 2016.</p>
        </p>
          <p>At the time of the project, there was no official ranking of the players or even a list with their names. We decided to take it upon us to create an interactive database for the highest performing players and clans using Google spreadsheets, Python3 and Discord API.
          </p>
          <p>Watching countless hours of gameplay and researching in forums related to the game, we created a database of over 2000 players and 100 clans, as well as tournaments that took place in the game from 2015 to 2021.
          </p>
         <p>Finally, we coded a Discord bot that made the database accessible to anyone, using simple commands on a dedicated Discord server. To this day, there have been around 1000 individual users, making more than 55.000 interactions with the bot, which is running 24/7 on a linux-based web hosting service. The feedback from users has been overwhelmingly positive.</p>
         <h3>Creating an interactive database using Discord API and Python 3</h3>
         <p>The project started in late 2020 when we first began to collect data about as many players as possible. Not only did we collect their nicknames, but also did we store their nationality and clans in the database. When the database reached a content of 1000 players, we began implementing the Discord application, while simultaneously still growing the database.  </p>
          <figure>      <img src="pedia.gif" class="articleimage"><figcaption>Using the clan command, users can quickly access key information about a clan such as its region, its main country, its foundation date, its founder, trophies it won and a list of its members.. </figcaption></figure>
          <br><p>Using the discord API, and various Python3 modules such as numpy and pandas, we coded a tool that searches for certain data in the spreadsheets (specified by the user) and then outputs it as a Discord embed message. To our knowledge, this is the first Discord application of this kind. After releasing the project to the public, we added multiple new features, such as a command that allows user to submit new players to the database, a donation feature and more.</p>
          <figure>      <img src="pedia2.gif" class="articleimage"><figcaption>The tournament command is one of the most popular one and allows users to retrace the history of the most famous tournaments that were organized in the game. </figcaption></figure>
          <br><h3>Leaving a legacy</h3>
          <div id="othdiv4"></div>
          <div id="othdiv5"></div>
          <p>As other more important projects entered our lives, we soon lacked the spare time to continue updating and further developing the project. However, the bot is still running and being used hundreds of times every day by a vast number of people. The discord server also progressively became a place for the community of the game to reunite, even after the game becoming less active.</p>
